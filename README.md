In this project, we designed and built a webApp that allows customer to trade stocks. The database is desugned in MySQL. This database stores the information of Stocks, customers, employees, and managers. This database also has many built-in transactions and is running behind a webpage that includes all the user interface. For the server we used TomCat 9.0.
